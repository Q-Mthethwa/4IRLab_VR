The exponential growth in technology usage has seen a significant increase in businesses with corporations asking themselves how they can better reduce the costs of their work processes.
Effective employee training is essential for mitigating equipment misuse and promoting efficient work processes. 
Current processes are lacking efficiency with managers having to train new employees on how to use even the simplest office appliances. 
This research proposes using Virtual Reality to train workers on how to operate office equipment efficiently thereby reducing the need to train each employee individually. 
For this research a virtual space is created of the 4IR Lab of Excellence as the workplace for this experiment. 
With basic functionality of the actual 4IR Lab, to ensure that the Virtual environment is as close as possible to the actual environment and is realistic.
The virtual environment will undergo verification and testing before the experiment is conducted to ensure users have a smooth experience. 
The experiment includes a sample of DUT Students who will be selected to use the virtual environment before entering the actual environment. 
The subjects will interact with the virtual environment and understand how to operate its equipment using the hints provided within the virtual space. 
After the users have completed their training using the virtual environment they will be brought to the real 4IR Lab environment where they will be tasked with operating the equipment without any assistance. 
How well the users perform in a real-world scenario will be the basis of the experiment success.
